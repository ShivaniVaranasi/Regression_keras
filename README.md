# Regression_keras

This model focusses on implementing regression with Keras.
Intially, just one hidden layer is used with 10 neurons and 50 epochs without normalization.
This is later followed by normalized inputs and the score was compared. (found an improvement due to normalized features)
Part C focusses on updating the previous step with 100 epochs and part D finally is an extension of this model.
It includes 3 hidden layers.
